# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [1.3.19] - 2022-10-14
### Changed
ARGUS-31386
- Reduced the default value for max poll records in KafkaConsumerProvider.

## [1.3.18] - 2022-09-15
### Fixed
INCIDENT-156015
- The `alive` metric in `KafkaDocumentSource` is no longer registered if no subscriber is attached

### Upgrade notes
- Nagios alarms will start triggering because this metric is no longer reporting any data. If this is true for your service, this is expected behavior.
  The way to solve this is to delete the metric from Graphite.

## [1.3.17] - 2022-09-05
### Fixed
ARGUS-30461
- Made KafkaDocumentBatch into public class

## [1.3.16] - 2022-08-26
### Changed
ARGUS-30461
- Added method `reject()` to the DocumentChannel `DocumentBatch` interface, allowing client to explicitly reject (rollback) the batch.
- Simplified Kafka implementation of Document Subscription.

### Upgrade notes
- Implementations of `KafkaDocumentChannelListener` are now *required* to implement 
  `void documentReceived(KafkaDocument<T> document)`. The default implementation of `void documentReceived(T document)` 
  is to throw `UnsupportedOperationException`. This may be overridden if the implementation
  can work without receiving a `KafkaDocument`

## [1.3.15] - 2022-08-22
### Added
ARGUS-30416
- Add support for custom key serializer in `KafkaDocumentDestination`.
- Clients may pass a lambda `Function<T, String>` to select the correct String value to partition the document by.
- Clients may use this to ensure that documents are partitioned consistently by some custom value.  

## [1.3.14] - 2021-12-06
### Changed
ARGUS-26277
- Add new method `KafkaDocumentSource.waitForAssignment(Duration)` to let clients wait for assignments to complete
- Improve `getCursor()` handling to make sure the cursor value is set to the current position of the source before returning 

## [1.3.0] - 2021-03-09

### Added
ARGUS-22135
- Implemented cursor support in `KafkaDocumentSource`, allowing a consumer to receive a cursor to resume previous position.
    - New method `KafkaDocumentSource.seek()` to support seeking to a specified position 
    - New transport class `KafkaDocument` to carry a document with metadata
    - New method `KafkaDocumentSource.pollDocuments` returning `KafkaDocument` 
    - New interface `KafkaDocumentChannelListener` extending `DocumentChannelListener`, receiving `KafkaDocument` 

See [README.md](documentchannel-kafka/README.md) for details on how to use.

## [1.2.19] - 2019-09-15
### Fixed
ARGUS-14802

the server will respond with an IllegalDeserializationException and close the channel.
- If deserialization error occurs on client side when receiving server response,
the client will forward the IllegalDeserializationException to the upstream client.
- In both cases, the client will be notified using `notifyError(Throwable)`.
